The current electrical power systems experience fast changes because renewable energy sources and distributed generation and power electronic converters now produce greater electrical output than before. The grid now operates with lower natural rotational inertia because high penetration of renewable energy sources has resulted in increased frequency instability and cascading failure risks. Conventional protection mechanisms based on deterministic thresholds are often inadequate under such dynamic operating conditions. This internship conducted at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus focused on large-scale fault simulation, dataset generation, signal processing, and development of intelligent data-driven protection mechanisms. Using DIgSILENT PowerFactory, multiple power system networks including the IEEE 39-bus system, MV microgrid, wind farm system, and 42-bus system were modeled. Various fault types such as LLL, LLG, LG, and LL were created at multiple buses and transmission lines. High-resolution time-series data of voltages, currents, frequency, power, and sequence components were extracted. The collected datasets were processed in MATLAB to obtain DQ components (Vd, Vq) and other derived features. Machine learning models including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and GRU neural networks were implemented for intelligent fault classification and Critical Clearing Time estimation. The internship establishes a comprehensive framework integrating simulation, signal processing, and artificial intelligence for next-generation smart grid protection.
